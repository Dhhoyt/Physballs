# Physballs

## A small physics simulations engine

Physballs is a small game that simulates a small solar system. The goal is to make Physballs
as fun and accessible as it can be! it will also work as a tool for my future projects.

## Installing
To install Physballs you first need Python 3.x you will also need git.

1. Open your terminal and past the following command.
`git clone https://github.com/xsync3d/Physballs`
if you're on windows you might want to open the folder where you want Physballs installed by pasting the directory in the terminal.

2. If you're on linux execute the following commands.
   1. `ls /Physballs`
